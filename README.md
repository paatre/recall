# Recall

This tool collects your activity from various sources and generates a
summarized, chronological timeline for a specific day. It's designed to give
you a "perfect memory" of what you've worked on, making it easier to fill out
timesheets, write progress reports, or simply reflect on your day.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `uv` tool for building and installing the package, and also for development
  purposes
- Access to the data sources you want to collect activity from (e.g., Google
Calendar, GitLab, Slack, etc.) and the necessary permissions to read the data

## Collectors

These are the data sources currently supported:

- Firefox browsing history
- Google Calendar events
- GitLab activity
- Slack messages
- Shell command history

## Installation and usage

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paatre/recall.git
cd recall
```

### Install the package

There are multiple ways to install the package but the recommended way is to
is to use `uv tool`.

Using `uv tool`:
```
uv tool install .
```

This will create a command line tool called `recall` which
gets installed into your `$HOME/.local/bin` directory so you can run it from
anywhere.

Alternatively, you can install the tool with something like `pipx`.

### Usage

After installation, you can run the tool using:

```bash
recall
```

The tool will generate a timeline for today's activity by default. You can also
specify a date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format to get the activity for that specific day.

```bash
recall 2025-01-01
```

### Example output

```
$ recall YYYY-MM-DD
    - ✅ Firefox collector found X events.
    - ✅ Calendar collector found X events.
    - ✅ GitLab collector found X events.
    - ✅ Shell collector found X events.
    - ✅ Slack collector found X events.

--- Summarized Activity Timeline for YYYY-MM-DD ---

## Configuration

The tool uses a combination of environment variables and configuration files.

### Global configuration file

Create a global configuration file to the `.config` directory in your home
directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/recall
touch ~/.config/recall/config.env
```

Add your secrets to this `config.env` file. Read the following section section
for collector-specific setup instructions.

The tool also supports loading environment variables from a `.env` file in the
current working directory. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

### Collector-specific configurations

This section describes the setup required for each collector.

#### Google Calendar

- Follow the [Google Calendar API Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python)
to enable the API, configure the OAuth consent screen and download your
`credentials.json`.
- Place the `credentials.json` file in `~/.config/recall/`.
- The first time you run the tool, it will open a browser window for you to
authorize access. This will create a `token.json` and store it in the
`~/.config/recall/` directory for future runs so that you
don't need to authorize again.

#### GitLab

Add the following to your `config.env` file:

```
GITLAB_URL="https://your.gitlab-instance.com"
GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
GITLAB_USER_ID="your_gitlab_user_id"
```

#### Slack

> [!note]
> This collector is not available yet to public use. This is currently being
> tested internally.

- You need a Slack User Token. You can generate one for your workspace.
- Add the following to your `config.env` file:

```
SLACK_USER_TOKEN="xoxp-..."
```

#### Shell history

This collector reads from a custom history file located at
`~/.recall.log` by default. This is required to generate
timestamps even if the commands are executed in different shells (e.g., when
using `tmux`). It is recommended to add these lines to your `.bashrc` to
ensure this:

```bash
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z "

export PROMPT_LOG_FILE="$HOME/.work_activity_history.log"

log_prompt_command() {
    local last_command=$(history 1)
    if [[ "$last_command" =~ ^[[:space:]]*[0-9]+[[:space:]]+[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}\+?[0-9]{4}[[:space:]]+(.*) ]]; then
        local command_to_log="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
        local current_time=$(date +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z")
        echo "$current_time $command_to_log" >> "$PROMPT_LOG_FILE"
    fi
}

export PROMPT_COMMAND="log_prompt_command"
```

#### Firefox

No special configuration is needed. The collector automatically tries to find
your Firefox `places.sqlite` database.

Here are the default locations that are supported currently:

- Linux: `~/.mozilla/firefox/` or `snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox`
- macOS: `Library/Application Support/Firefox`
- Windows: `AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles`

## Extending the Tool

You can easily add new data sources by creating a new collector.

1. Create a new file in the `src/recall/collectors/` directory (e.g., `my_collector.py`).
2. In this file, create a class that inherits from `BaseCollector` (from `collectors/base.py`).
3. Implement the `name()` and `collect()` methods. The `collect()` method must be `async` and return a list of `Event` objects.
4. Add your new collector class to the `ENABLED_COLLECTORS` list in `src/recall/main.py`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Especially in the form of new collectors for new
data sources. This project started as a personal tool but hopefully others will
find it useful too with more data sources.

Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Make
sure to follow the existing code style. For example, use Ruff for linting and
formatting.
